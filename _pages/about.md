I am a behavioural scientist who studied at Nottingham Trent University. My education specialised in Psychology (BSc) and Psychological Research Methods (MRes). I will be adopting the use of a probabilistic generative modelling approach for my future research and case studies (see [Michael Betancourt's website for more details](https://betanalpha.github.io/))

I will be uploading my own projects, case studies, and blog posts on this website over the next few years as a way to improve my computational, mathematical and other specialised skills. 

Current skills that I am learning are posted [here](https://github.com/Sam-Vizcaino-Vickers/README)
